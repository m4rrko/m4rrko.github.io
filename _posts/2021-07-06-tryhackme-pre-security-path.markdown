So, you are telling me you want to be a penetration tester? In that case, don't be like this kid:

<div style="text-align: center;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px">

</div>

And do it right! To fully understand what you are doing as a penetration tester, and why are things working as they are, you need to have some fundamentals to back you up.

Luckily for you, there is this platform called <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> aimed at learning cyber security, using hands-on exercises and labs.

<div style="text-align: center;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px">

</div>

And they got this brand new <a href="https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity">Pre Security Learning Path</a> which contains Introduction to Cyber Security, Network fundamentals, Web Works principles, Linux and Windows fundamentals.

Network fundamentals will provide you with fundamentals about networking. What a surprise! 

But for real now. This category contains 5 rooms where each focuses on a different aspect of networking. Rooms contain practical exercises where you can see how packets travel in the network, how they behave under different circumstances, and some basic network commands.
